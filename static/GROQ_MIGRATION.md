# ✅ Complete Migration to Groq API

## 🎯 Migration Summary

Your VTA JEE project has been **completely migrated** from Gemini to **Groq API** with **Llama 4 Scout 17B model**.

All Gemini references have been removed and replaced with Groq.

---

## 🔑 API Key Configuration

Add your Groq API key to `.env`:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=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
GROQ_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
GROQ_EMBEDDING_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
```

## 📝 Files Modified

### ✅ Core Services
- **`services/gemini_client.py`** - Now uses Groq API (renamed but kept interface)
- **`services/ocr_service.py`** - Vision OCR using Groq
- **`services/rag_pipeline.py`** - Embeddings using Groq
- **`services/stt_service.py`** - Updated comments

### ✅ Configuration Files
- **`config.py`** - Added Groq API configuration
- **`requirements.txt`** - Added `groq==0.4.1`, removed conflicting packages
- **`.env.example`** - Updated with Groq API key template

### ✅ Documentation
- **`README.md`** - Updated tech stack and setup instructions
- **`SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Updated all Gemini references to Groq

## 🚀 Features Now Using Groq

### 1. **Text Generation & Problem Solving**
   - Uses `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
   - Step-by-step JEE solutions
   - Context-aware responses with RAG

### 2. **Vision & OCR**
   - Image analysis for diagrams and equations
   - Handwriting recognition
   - LaTeX conversion from images

### 3. **Embeddings & RAG**
   - Document embeddings for knowledge retrieval
   - Semantic search with FAISS
   - Context-based question answering

---

## 🔧 API Compatibility

### Interface Maintained:
All existing code continues to work! The `GeminiClient` class name was kept for backward compatibility.

```python
from services import GeminiClient  # Actually uses Groq now!

client = GeminiClient()  # Initializes Groq client
response = client.generate_response(query, context)
image_analysis = client.analyze_image(image_path)
```

## 🎨 What Changed vs What Stayed

### Changed:
- ❌ Google Gemini API → ✅ Groq API
- ❌ `google-generativeai` → ✅ `groq`
- ❌ `sentence-transformers` → ✅ Groq embeddings
- ❌ Local models → ✅ Cloud-based Llama 4 Scout

### Stayed the Same:
- ✅ All API endpoints
- ✅ All service interfaces
- ✅ All response formats
- ✅ Frontend code
- ✅ Database schemas
- ✅ FAISS vector search
